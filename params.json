If a **map** function is not specified then the identity function is used instead.\r\n\r\nIf **closeOnError** flag is set to true, then any error in the **map** function or from the input stream will complete the `Future` with the error.\r\nOtherwise, any errors will be swallowed and excluded from the final average.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    var input = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(seconds : 1), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n    StreamExt.average(input).then(print);\r\n\r\n\r\n### buffer\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.buffer` method creates a new stream which buffers values from the input stream produced within the sepcified **duration** and return the buffered values as a list.\r\n\r\nThe buffered stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has completed and any buffered values have been pushed\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input \t = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 10), (n) => n);\r\n    var buffered = StreamExt.buffer(input, new Duration(seconds : 1));\r\n\r\n\r\n### combineLatest\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.combineLastest` method merges two streams into one by using the **selector** function to generate a new value whenever one of the streams produces a value.\r\n\r\nThe merged stream will complete if:\r\n* both input streams have completed\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var stream1 = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 10), (n) => n);\r\n    var stream2 = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 100), (n) => n);\r\n\r\n    var merged\t= StreamExt.combineLatest(stream1, stream2, (a, b) => a + b);\r\n\r\n\r\n### concat\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.concat` method concatenates two streams together, when the first stream completes the second stream is subscribed to.\r\nUntil the first stream is done any values and errors from the second stream is ignored.\r\n\r\nThe concatenated stream will complete if:\r\n* both input streams have completed (if stream 2 completes before stream 1 then the concatenated stream is completed when stream 1 completes)\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received in the active input stream (stream 1 until it completes, then stream 2)\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var stream1 = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 10), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n    var stream2 = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 100), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n\r\n    var concat\t= StreamExt.concat(stream1, stream2);\r\n\r\n\r\n### delay\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.delay` method creates a new stream whose values are sourced from the input stream but each delivered after the specified **duration**.\r\n\r\nThe delayed stream will complete if:\r\n* the input has completed and the delayed complete message has been pushed\r\n* the **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received from the input stream\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input   = new StreamController.broadcast().stream;\r\n\r\n    // each event from the input stream is delivered 1 second after it was originally received\r\n    var delayed\t= StreamExt.delay(input, new Duration(seconds : 1));\r\n\r\n\r\n### max\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.max` method returns the maximum value as a `Future` when the input stream is done, as determined by the supplied **compare** function which compares the current maximum value against any new value produced by the input stream.\r\n\r\nThe **compare** function must act as a `Comparator`.\r\n\r\nIf **closeOnError** flag is set to true, then any error in the **compare** function will complete the `Future` with the error.\r\nOtherwise, any errors will be swallowed and excluded from the final maximum.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(seconds : 1), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n    StreamExt.max(input, (a, b) => a.compareTo(b)).then(print);\r\n\r\n\r\n### merge\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.merge` method merges two streams into a single unitifed output stream.\r\n\r\nThe merged stream will forward any values and errors received from the input streams and will complete if:\r\n* both input streams have completed\r\n* the **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received from either input stream\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    var stream1 = new StreamController.broadcast().stream;\r\n    var stream2 = new StreamController.broadcast().stream;\r\n\r\n    var merged\t= StreamExt.merge(stream1, stream2);\r\n\r\n\r\n### min\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.min` method returns the minimum value as a `Future` when the input stream is done, as determined by the supplied **compare** function which compares the current minimum value against any new value produced by the input stream.\r\n\r\nThe **compare** function must act as a `Comparator`.\r\n\r\nIf **closeOnError** flag is set to true, then any error in the **compare** function will complete the `Future` with the error.\r\nOtherwise, any errors will be swallowed and excluded from the final minimum.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(seconds : 1), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n    StreamExt.min(input, (a, b) => a.compareTo(b)).then(print);\r\n\r\n\r\n### repeat\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.repeat` method allows you to repeat the input stream for the specified number of times.\r\nIf **repeatCount** is not set, then the input stream will be repeated **indefinitely**.\r\n\r\nThe `done` value is not delivered when the input stream completes, but only after the input stream has been repeated the required number of times.\r\n\r\nThe output stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has been repeated the required number of times\r\n* the **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error has been received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input    = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(seconds : 1), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n    var repeated = StreamExt.repeat(input, repeatCount : 3);\r\n\r\n\r\n### sample\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.sample` method creates a new stream by taking the last value from the input stream for every specified **duration**.\r\n\r\nThe sampled stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has completed and any sampled message has been delivered\r\n* the **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error has been received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input   = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 150), (n) => n).take(100);\r\n    var sampled = StreamExt.sample(input, new Duration(seconds : 1));\r\n\r\n\r\n### scan\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.scan` method creates a new stream by applying an **accumulator** function over the values produced by the input stream and returns each intermediate result with the specified seed and accumulator.\r\n\r\nThe output stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has completed\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input        = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 150), (n) => n);\r\n    var runningTotal = StreamExt.scan(input, 0, (acc, elem) => acc + elem);\r\n\r\n\r\n### startWith\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.startWith` method allows you to prefix values to a stream.\r\nThe supplied values are delivered as soon as the listener is subscribed before the listener receives values from the input stream.\r\n\r\nThe output stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has completed\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input  = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(milliseconds : 150), (n) => n);\r\n    var output = StreamExt.startWith(input, [ -3, -2, -1 ]);\r\n\r\n\r\n### sum\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.sum` method returns the sum of all the input values as a `Future` when the input stream is done, using the supplied **map** function to convert each input value into a `num`.\r\n\r\nIf a **map** function is not specified then the identity function is used.\r\n\r\nIf **closeOnError** flag is set to true, then any error in the **map** function will complete the `Future` with the error.\r\nOtherwise, any errors will be swallowed and excluded from the final sum.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input = new Stream.periodic(new Duration(seconds : 1), (n) => n).take(10);\r\n    StreamExt.sum(input).then(print);\r\n\r\n\r\n### throttle\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.throttle` method creates a new stream based on values produced by the specified input, upon forwarding a value from the input stream it'll ignore any subsequent values produced by the input stream until the the flow of new values has paused for the specified duration, after which the last value produced by the input stream is then delivered.\r\n\r\nThe throttled stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has completed and the any throttled message has been delivered\r\n* the **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received from the input stream\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input     = new StreamController.broadcast().stream;\r\n    var throttled = StreamExt.throttle(input, new Duration(seconds : 1));\r\n\r\n\r\n### window\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.window` method projects each value from the input stream into consecutive non-overlapping windows.\r\nEach value proudced by the output stream contains a list of values up to the specified count.\r\n\r\nThe output stream will complete if:\r\n* the input stream has completed and any buffered elements have been upshed\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var input \t = new StreamController.broadcast().stream;\r\n    var windowed = StreamExt.window(input, 3);\r\n\r\n\r\n### zip\r\n\r\nThe `StreamExt.zip` method zips two streams into one by combining their values in a pairwise fashion.\r\n\r\nThe zipped stream will complete if:\r\n* either input stream has completed\r\n* **closeOnError** flag is set to true and an error is received\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    var mouseMove = document.onMouseMove;\r\n    var mouseDrags =\r\n      StreamExt\r\n        .zip(mouseMove,\r\n             mouseMove.skip(1),\r\n             (MouseEvent left, MouseEvent right) => new MouseMove(right.screen.x - left.screen.x, right.screen.y - left.screen.y))\r\n        .where((_) => isDragging);\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nPlease take
