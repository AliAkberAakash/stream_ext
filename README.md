stream_ext
========

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/theburningmonk/stream_ext/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/theburningmonk/stream_ext/latest)

This is a port of the Rx functions for working with Dart's `Stream` type, which already has the basic set of Rx APIs such as `select` and `where`.

This library adds the more 'exotic' Rx functions such as `delay`, `buffer`, `scan`, `throttle`, `zip`, `merge`, etc. to help make working with Dart's `Stream` type even easier!
